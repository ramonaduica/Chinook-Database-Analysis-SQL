# SQL Data Analysis Project: Chinook Database

This project demonstrates strong SQL data analysis skills using the **Chinook sample database**. Chinook models a digital music store, providing data on customers, invoices, artists, albums, tracks, and genres, making it an excellent dataset for business analysis.

The primary goal of this project is to **extract meaningful business insights** from the data through a series of complex SQL queries, showcasing proficiency in data aggregation, joins, grouping, and reporting.

### ðŸ§® Project Objectives & Analytical Focus

The analysis is structured to answer key business questions across the sales, customer, and catalog domains:

* **Customer Behavior:** Understanding customer distribution and identifying top spending patterns.
* **Sales Performance:** Measuring revenue trends and identifying top-performing countries.
* **Catalog Insights:** Analyzing genre popularity and identifying top artists by volume.
* **Technical Proficiency:** Demonstrating mastery of aggregation (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`), multi-table `JOIN`s, `GROUP BY`, and data formatting (`ROUND`, `DATE_FORMAT`).

### ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

1.  **Install & Start Server:** Install **XAMPP** (or a similar stack) and ensure the **MySQL server** is running.
2.  **Connect:** Use a database client like **HeidiSQL** to connect to your local MySQL instance (`localhost`).
3.  **Load Database:** Execute the Chinook schema file (e.g., `Chinook_MySql.sql`) to create the database structure and populate the tables with data.
4.  **Run Queries:** Open and run the queries found in the **`project_queries.sql`** file.
5.  **Review:** Examine the output to confirm the insights outlined in this README.
